    <p>
        Good design techniques: Keeping the same color scheme and background throughout all pages, all pages have the same type of layout structure, images laid out and also responsive for screensize
        <br><br>
        Organization of information: Different topics kept on their own page, pictures match each paragraph of information
        <br><br>
        Content: Grammar and spelling correct and (hopefully) interesting to read about, varied content about a lot of different topics
        <br><br>
        Navigation: Navigation on every page, navigation includes all pages available and all labeled
        <br><br>
        Use of HTML5 and CSS3: Yes, all pages are HTML and have one CSS page they all use, all styles (including for positioning and text) are in the CSS external file
        <br><br>
        Reference Page: Yes, although there is nothing to cite since everything came from myself and my dad so it is part of the contact page as well
