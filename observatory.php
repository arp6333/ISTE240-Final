            <h1>Mauna Kea Observatory</h1>
            <p class="center">On the dormant volcano Mauna Kea, there are 13 observatories and research facilities spread about. Mauna Kea has the second highest point in all of Hawaii and is located on the Big Island. We got to visit one of the observatories which was near a small peak. While there was still sunlight, we climbed up the small peak and watched the sunset from above the clouds. Once it was dark, the specialists there pulled out four high-tech telescopes and aimed them at different celestial objects and talked about each one that was visible. The sky was super clear and free from light pollution making it really easy to see the stars.</p>
