    <h1>First Week</h1>
    
    <p class="center">For the first week, we stayed in Hilo at Lahiki O Ka Hale which means house of the rising sun. This was on the rainy part of the Big Island. Our house was in the middle of a forested area and a five minute walk to the ocean with only other houses spread apart nearby. There were a lot of tiny frogs called coqu√≠ frogs which are extremely loud throughout the evening.</p>

    <h1>Second Week</h1>
    <p class="center">For the second week, we stayed at Kona Island Resort in Kona. This was on a sunnier part of the Big Island. The place was a resort and not a home like the last week so nearby was a golf course, a public swimming pool, restaurants, and of course the ocean. There were friendly cats that would come and ask for food each night. Watching the sunset and sunrise was easy as the golf course left lots of open ground to see as much as possible in the sky.</p>

    <p class="center">It was nice to stay in both a normal house and an actual resort while in Hawaii to get a varied experience along with getting to see two sides of the same island.</p>
