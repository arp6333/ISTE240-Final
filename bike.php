    <h1>Active Volcano</h1>
    
    <p class="center">At the time that we were visiting Hawaii, the volcano Mauna Loa was active and a section with lava erupting was visible for people to go and see (from a distance). Mauna Loa is one of the most active volcanoes in the world. The problem was it was very, very, far out on hardened magma and rubble so no cars were allowed to drive to it. Luckily, people had bike rentals available to take and ride the long trek out. We waited until evening as it was much easier and better to see the lava at dark then rented our bikes and set off.</p>

    <p class="center">The trip felt like hours because of the bumpy path but was most likely about an hour long. By the time we reached the spot, there was tens of other people crowded around it making it harder to see, plus we all had to stand quite far away since it is hot molten lava spewing out. Regardless, it was a very unique and amazing thing to see. The ride back was completely in the dark so we all had headlamps on our helmets. It felt twice as long as the way there and we couldn't see how far away we were. Once we finally got back, everyone was dead tired but it was worth it.</p>
