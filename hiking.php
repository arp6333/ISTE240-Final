    <h1>Hiking Towards a Green Sand Beach</h1>
    <p class="center">Far out on the coast seemingly in the middle of nowhere with no roads or houses is a green sand beach called Papak≈çlea Beach. It is one of only four green sand beaches in the world. There are no roads or even paths for regular cars to drive on but there were locals with off-road Jeeps offering rides down. We declined for the way there and decided to hike out towards the beach. It was mildly hot but got hotter the more we walked. The scenery was wide open fields with the ocean in view half a mile away. It was around an hour and a half of tiresome walking while people getting rides drove past us every so often.</p>

    <p class="center"> Approaching the beach, it looked like only a cliffside surrounding a drop from far away. Once we reached the top of the cliff, we saw a rocky cliffside where people had to carefully climb down to be in the actual sand. I personally didn't climb down because I was so tired from the walk there so I enjoyed the view from above. The sand wasn't quite the imagined bright green color but was slightly tinted compared to regular sand. We decided to take up an offer for a ride back since we were all exhausted from the hike there.</p>

    <p class="center"> We took many other small walks or hikes by the ocean to enjoy the scenery whenever we could.</p>
