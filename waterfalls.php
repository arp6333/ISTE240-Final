    <p class="center">Hawaii is full of both large and small waterfalls. There were some smaller waterfalls at the <a class="link" href="./garden.html">flower garden</a> we visited. We also got to walk through a natural cave (too dark for pictures). It was straightforward but still strange to be walking and not knowing how far it goes in darkness.</p>

    <p class="center">There are waterfalls to see everywhere. Even the smallest ones are very pretty to see. By the water, there are sometimes small crabs and turtles. Most bigger waterfalls we can only see from a distance since everything is being kept in it's natural state, no roads or pathways to get closer to anything.</p>
