    <h1>Zipline</h1>
    
    <p class="center">My family decided to take one of the ziplines they offer on the Big Island. I personally did not go on the zipline because I thought it was a bit too much for me but is worth showing.</p>

    <h1>Macadamia Nut Farm</h1>
    
    <p class="center">After the zipline, another place we visited was an organic coffee and macadamia nut farm called Mahina Mele Farm. It is on the coast of Kona on the Big Island. There was a very nice woman who lived on the farm with her family including friendly dogs and cats. They gave my family and I a tour of the farm and showed us all of the trees and machinery they use for sorting and collecting all kinds of Hawaiian fruits and nuts.</p>
