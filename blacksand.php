    <h1>Black Sand Beach</h1>
    <p class="center">There are a few black sand beaches around Hawaii that people can visit. When we visited one, it was a rainy day so the water was a bit too cold to go in. The 'sand' is more of rough, small rocks rather than soft sand. There were small crabs all over the rocks that skitter away when people get close.</p>

    <h1>Hot Spring</h1>
    <p class="center">After the black sand beach, we visited a geothermal hot spring. The water was naturally mildly warm and shallow enough to stand in most areas. There were tons of small fish that would hang out while people swam around.</p>
